Build a Tribute Page
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks

User Stories:

Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div
You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
Your img element should be centered within its parent element
Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!

Note: Be sure to add <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS

            <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1970</span> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1983</span> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.</p></li>
